# Libvirt-Single-GPU-Passthrough

## Intro
This repo contains my personal configs on Libvirt **single** GPU passthrough, stripped down to the most generic way possible. Here you will find templates and files you can customize to your liking if you have similar hardware or take a look at the options to build your own configuration if you don't.
