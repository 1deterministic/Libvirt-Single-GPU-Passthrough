Arch Linux using the OVMF from Fedora 31 or Fedora 31 with kernel 5.3.x seems to be the best working setups
  intel_iommu=on iommu=pt kvm.ignore_msrs=1 kvm.report_ignored_msrs=0

I am able to run the cpu at the maximum clock speed with these parameters and perfgovernor active
  intel_idle.max_cstate=1 processor.max_cstate=1

For some reason 5.4 kernels in Fedora 31 crash the host when starting up passthrough virtual machines for the 3rd time without rebooting, 5.3.16 does not have this issue
